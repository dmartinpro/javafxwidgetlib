**JavaFX rich components library (charts)**

_NOTE : This is an early stage project. The source may be not as clean as you can expect. I'll try to fix that ASAP_

The main and first goal of this project is to provide a simple example of the ability to wrap existing Swing components to provide an advanced set of possibilities with JavaFX.

It works the same way some GWT librairies work too : as a wrapper around existing cool things.

My first thought about JavaFX was : "Why the hell didn't they provide rich components whereas they have a bunch of months late". And yes, I still think they should provide native (I mean non wrapper) components.

So, enjoy (or not after all) some JFreeCharts examples at this address :
